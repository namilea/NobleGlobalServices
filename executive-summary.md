# Noble Global Services | Executive Summary

## 1. Internal Assessment Overview
Noble Global Services conducted a comprehensive internal security assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities within the organizationâ€™s internal network. Using industry-leading tools like Qualys, we evaluated key areas such as system configurations, firewall settings, and network traffic. The results highlight critical areas needing attention to maintain a secure infrastructure.

## 2. External Assessment Overview
Our external security assessment, conducted via Tenable, evaluated external threats targeting the organization. The assessment identified areas of potential exposure from outside actors and provided actionable insights to fortify network defenses.

## 3. Compliance Correlation
The assessment covered the following compliance frameworks, all of which were successfully passed:
- **PCI DSS**
- **HIPAA**
- **SOC 2**
- **ISO/IEC 27001**
- **NIST CSF**

## 4. Security Posture Score
The security posture score reflects the overall security health, derived from both internal and external assessments. The score is based on the severity of identified vulnerabilities, with the majority being low severity or information-gathering in nature.

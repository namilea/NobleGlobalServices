Noble Global Services | Executive Summary
1. Internal Assessment Overview
Noble Global Services conducted a comprehensive internal security assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses within the organization’s internal network. Using industry-leading tools such as Qualys, we evaluated key areas of the infrastructure, including system configurations, firewall settings, and network traffic monitoring. The findings provide insight into areas that require remediation to improve overall network security.

2. External Assessment Overview
An external security assessment was performed to evaluate potential threats from external sources. Using Tenable, we analyzed network exposure, endpoint vulnerabilities, and perimeter defenses. This assessment focused on how external actors might exploit weaknesses, providing a realistic simulation of potential cyber threats from outside the network.

3. Compliance Correlation
The assessment covered the following key frameworks:

PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
HIPAA: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
SOC 2: Service Organization Control
ISO/IEC 27001: International standard for information security management
NIST CSF: National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework
All frameworks were successfully passed, and the compliance correlation demonstrates that the organization’s internal and external security measures align with these critical regulatory requirements.

4. Security Posture Score
The security posture score reflects the organization’s overall security health, based on internal and external assessments. The majority of vulnerabilities identified were of low severity or for information-gathering purposes. While these vulnerabilities are not immediately critical, they still provide valuable insights for maintaining long-term network health and security.

Key Vulnerabilities
The vulnerabilities detected are not directly applicable to PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001, or NIST CSF compliance but are worth monitoring for potential use in network diagnostics. The five biggest vulnerability categories include:

Information Gathering Vulnerabilities
TCP/IP Configuration Issues
Firewall Configurations
Forensic Gaps
5. Summary of Findings
Internal Assessment Findings (via Qualys)
The internal assessment identified several low-severity vulnerabilities, primarily related to information gathering and TCP/IP configurations. These vulnerabilities do not present an immediate threat but require attention to prevent potential exploitation.

External Assessment Findings (via Tenable)
The external assessment focused on the organization’s perimeter defenses and found minimal medium or high-risk vulnerabilities. Most findings were information-gathering in nature, allowing us to proactively enhance defense mechanisms.

6. Visual Aids
Comparison of Total Vulnerabilities: A visual comparison between internal and external vulnerabilities reveals that the majority of detected issues are related to information gathering and low-severity risks.
Distribution of Vulnerabilities by Severity: Pie charts display the severity of vulnerabilities, further emphasizing that most detected issues are not critical but should still be addressed.
7. Recommendations for Remediation
To improve the overall security posture, the following actions are recommended:

Information Gathering Vulnerabilities: Regularly review and update system logs and monitoring to minimize information exposure.
TCP/IP Issues: Implement best practices for TCP/IP configurations to prevent network inefficiencies and vulnerabilities.
Firewall Configurations: Strengthen firewall settings to block unnecessary traffic and restrict access to critical network segments.
Security Posture Improvement: Perform ongoing security posture assessments to stay ahead of emerging threats and maintain compliance with the above frameworks.
Compliance Reviews: Schedule regular reviews to ensure continued adherence to PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, ISO/IEC 27001, and NIST CSF standards.

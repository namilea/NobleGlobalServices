# 3rd-Party Vendor Risk Management  
**Third-Party Risk Management SAQ (Self-Assessment Questionnaire)**

## Introduction

This **Third-Party Vendor Risk Management Security Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)** is designed to assess the compliance and security measures implemented by third-party vendors. It helps evaluate critical areas such as data protection, access control, incident response, and legal compliance. This questionnaire aims to ensure vendors meet the necessary security standards to safeguard sensitive information and maintain compliance with relevant regulations.

## 1. Third-Party Information Security Policies
- Does the third-party vendor have a documented and enforced information security policy?
- How does this policy align with industry-recognized security frameworks such as NIST or ISO 27001?

## 2. Secure Data Handling and Encryption
- How is sensitive data transmitted and stored by the third-party vendor?
- What encryption protocols are used for data at rest and in transit?
- Are there any additional security measures for high-risk data (e.g., personal identifiable information)?

## 3. Secure Access Control & Authentication
- How does the third-party control access to sensitive systems and data?
- Are there multi-factor authentication (MFA) protocols in place?
- How frequently are access privileges reviewed and updated?

## 4. Incident Response and Data Breach Reporting
- Does the third-party vendor have an incident response plan?
- How quickly are incidents involving data breaches reported?
- Are third-party vendors required to report breaches involving client data within a specific timeframe (e.g., 72 hours)?

## 5. Legal Compliance and Regulatory Obligations
- How does the third-party ensure compliance monitoring with local and international laws regarding data protection?
- What governance measures are in place to align with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS?

## 6. Business Continuity, Disaster Recovery, and Crisis Management
- What business continuity and disaster recovery plans does the third-party have in place?
- How often are these plans tested and updated?
- Does the vendor provide documentation of recovery times in case of major outages?

## 7. Vulnerability Management
- How does the third-party vendor handle vulnerabilities in their systems?
- Are vulnerability scans conducted regularly?
- How quickly are vulnerabilities patched once identified?

## 8. Subcontractor Security Compliance and Oversight
- Does the third-party vendor use subcontractors or other third parties?
- How does the third-party vendor ensure that subcontractors meet the same security and compliance standards?
- Are there documented procedures for monitoring the security practices of subcontractors?

## 9. Data Protection and Agreement Termination
- What happens to client data when the agreement with the third-party vendor is terminated?
- Is there a clear process for securely transferring or destroying data upon termination?
- Are records of data destruction provided?

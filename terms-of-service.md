# Terms of Service Agreement

### Introduction

This Agreement covers a comprehensive range of cybersecurity services, including but not limited to vulnerability assessments, compliance mapping, patch management, penetration testing, and ethical data handling practices.

### 1. Scope of Services
Noble Global Services provides comprehensive cybersecurity services, including vulnerability management, patch management, penetration testing, forensic investigation, compliance mapping, and subcontractor engagement services. This agreement outlines the terms and responsibilities related to all services provided by Noble Global Services and any related subcontractors.

---

### 2. Vulnerability Assessments and Compliance Mapping
Noble Global Services will perform vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses in the client's systems. Compliance mapping will be conducted to ensure that the client’s systems meet relevant regulatory frameworks, including but not limited to PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2 compliance standards.

- The results of these assessments will be provided in the form of a detailed report, which will include any recommended actions or remediations.

---

### 3. Patch Management
Noble Global Services may provide patch management services as needed, specifically in instances where security updates and patches are required to achieve or maintain compliance for the client’s systems. Patch management services will be provided in stages to ensure minimal disruption to the client’s operations, and each patch installation will be thoroughly documented.

- The client will be informed of the completion of the patching process, and the impact on system compliance will be evaluated and communicated accordingly.

---

### 4. Penetration Testing
Penetration testing services will be performed to assess the security posture of the client’s web-facing assets and internal systems. Noble Global Services offers penetration testing tailored to small and medium-sized businesses and will focus on network and portal vulnerabilities.

- Clients requiring more in-depth or specialized testing will be advised to consider engaging a specialized service provider with a larger budget.

---

### 5. Data Retention Policy
Noble Global Services will securely retain forensic data, including logs and audit trails, for a minimum period of 30 days following the completion of services. After the 30-day period, all logs and forensic data will be transferred from active storage to an external, secure environment.

- This secure environment is designed to meet compliance standards and mitigate any risks associated with unauthorized access or tampering.

- In the event of a breach or other security incident reported within the **30-day retention window**, access to logs and related forensic data will be provided for further analysis.

- Any forensic investigation requiring data older than 30 days will be considered an additional service, subject to a separate agreement, and may incur extra costs.

- The integrity of the logs will be verified during transmission to ensure that they are uncorrupted and ready for forensic use.

#### Transmission Methodology:
- Logs will be transmitted using secure file transfer protocols (SFTP) or a similar method to prevent unauthorized access or tampering during transit.

#### Log Integrity:
- It is the client’s responsibility to verify that logs are received and maintained in an authorized and tamper-free state. Noble Global Services will maintain records of the transmission process for accountability.

- All personally identifiable information (PII) stored on mobile devices (laptops, smartphones, etc.) and portable media (flash drives, backup tapes) must be protected by encryption in accordance with industry standards. Unauthorized access to such data will be reported, and the client will be notified in accordance with breach notification policies.

---

### 6. Service Log Transmission Procedure
In the event that a breach is reported within the 30-day retention period, Noble Global Services will securely transmit all relevant forensic data, logs, and audit trails to an authorized, designated official.

- The transmission of logs will be conducted via secure file transfer protocols (SFTP or similar) to prevent tampering or unauthorized access.
- Noble Global Services will document and log the transmission of data for accountability.

For any fund transfers exceeding $5,000, Noble Global Services requires a secondary means of communication (e.g., phone call or encrypted email) to validate the authenticity of the request before processing. This measure is intended to safeguard against unauthorized transfers and fraudulent requests.

---

### 7. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
Both parties agree to maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary, sensitive, or private information exchanged during the engagement. This includes, but is not limited to, intellectual property, client data, IP addresses, and system configurations.

- No information shared between Noble Global Services and the client will be disclosed to third parties without express written consent from the other party. This NDA will remain in effect for the duration of the contract and for a period of **12 Months** following the completion of services.

---

### 8. Non-Compete and Conflict of Interest
The client agrees not to engage directly with Noble Global Services outside of this agreement for a period of **12 months** following the conclusion of services to protect the subcontractor’s relationship.

- This non-compete clause ensures that all engagements are routed through the consultancy, preventing any conflicts of interest.

---

### 9. Limitations of Liability and Breach Response
Noble Global Services shall not be held liable for any breaches or compromises that occur after the termination of services, unless direct negligence in service delivery can be proven.

- Should web-facing assets or portals be altered, removed, or otherwise changed post-engagement, Noble Global Services will be exempt from forensic liability related to those changes.

---

### 10. Subcontractor Engagement and Third-Party Risks
Noble Global Services may engage with subcontractors to deliver certain services. The client will be informed if any subcontractor is involved in the engagement.

- The client assumes responsibility for third-party risks and ensures that any subcontractor used by Noble Global Services is vetted for their security practices.

- If a third-party service provider is compromised, Noble Global Services will assist with forensic investigation but will not assume liability for any breach caused by third-party actions.

---

### 11. Professional Conduct and Ethical Compliance
Noble Global Services adheres to strict ethical standards when conducting all services. Any attempt to alter, manipulate, or engage in fraudulent practices will be noted and reported to the relevant authorities.

- Noble Global Services enforces strict procedures for the removal of any content that may infringe upon intellectual property or privacy rights, including third-party content.

---

### 12. Termination of Responsibility
Once Noble Global Services has provided the final forensic report and delivered all necessary data, the client assumes full responsibility for securing their assets moving forward. Any further breaches or issues that arise post-service will require a new service agreement to address those incidents.

---

### 13. Dispute Resolution
Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be handled through mediation or arbitration, as agreed by both parties, before any legal action is taken. Noble Global Services and the client agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes related to service delivery, breach investigation, or liability.
